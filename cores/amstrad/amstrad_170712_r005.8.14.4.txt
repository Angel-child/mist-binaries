Green OSD while screen is in green mode.

Ligther pixels while bootloading : more luck to have a centered screen with some stupid screens.

Another tip : pressing page-up (the quick reset button) during a long time force ligther pixels (usefull when using multi-core using a stupid screen : do switch core, do press, do turn off/on screen, do unpress, tadam !)
