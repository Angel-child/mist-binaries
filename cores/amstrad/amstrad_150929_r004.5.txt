Game unlocked : Atomic Driver

DATABUS DMA (that is a bug in Amstrad 6128) is removed (alignement with JavaCPC) : no more INOUT
PULL UP was added to DATABUS, so
PRINT INP(&0800)
does return 255
CRTC has been debug : DATABUS DMA conflicts implemented : if A9_WRITE+IO_READ do write pull-up (255) and do return 255 (against freeze conflict do read ZZZZZZZZ)
Not possible to A9_READ during DATABUS MEM_RD|MEM_WR (againsts freeze conflict VHDL)

Know Can do also :
PRINT INP(&0100) without strange reboot...
PRINT INP(&0900) without strange reboot...
