WAIT_n generator seems pass quick good plustest.dsk instruction timing test (except ED B1/B9 that is not implemented in T80)
+ PhX is quite nice using options WAIT_n:slow VGA:vram72Hz.
+ Logon's run - 2D meets the aging bits still passing with options : WAIT_n:slow VGA:scandb50Hz
Thanks Sorgelig to get me back on this project :)
