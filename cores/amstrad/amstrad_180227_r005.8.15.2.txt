Merged with r005.8.16c33 :
- same OSD menu, with scandb50Hz|vram72Hz option
- scanlines is always ON (option removed from OSD)
+ Logon's run - 2D meets the aging bits passing with options : WAIT_n:slow VGA:scandb50Hz
- here OSD WAIT_n:quick|slow is using the new implementation (not yet calibrated completely) vs plustest.bin Instruction Timing testbench
