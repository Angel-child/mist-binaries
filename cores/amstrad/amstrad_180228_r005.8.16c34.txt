DEMO "Logon's run - 3D meets the aging bits" is OK
Z80 latences array using integers (0 1 2), in order to prove that plustest'instruction timing test is not suffisant here : adding latences does pass OK the testbench but "Logon's run" doesn't pass in this case.
Not theorical (from documented instructions in doc) latences are ones not commented as "human calibrate"

So problem is outside of this testbench area.
