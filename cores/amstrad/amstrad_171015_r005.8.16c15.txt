A fork of r005.8.16c3 (r005.8.16c4 is invalidated)
A Principe Of Concept applied to correct instruction timing one per one (I just applyed it to 2A instruction, that is them ok under plustest.dsk - "testbench 5")

Removed "MEM_wr:slow|quick" and replaced by "VGA:vram72Hz|scandb50Hz".
scandb50Hz is a merge of a strong very old work (rOO5.0c18 2015) around scandoubler, now I have enougth place to put both implemented (PS : mode TV is still here, see scandoubler in mist.ini)
I don't like personnaly scandoubler with CPC, because it doesn't run fine with basic mode 2.
But as it permits showing the background flying 1943 airplane on "Logon's run - 3D meets the aging bits 2017" demo, it's cool to keep this feature.
It will certainly also permits to progress with graphicals testbenchs also.

It's still in progress, but some would have lot of fun playing with scandb50Hz.
