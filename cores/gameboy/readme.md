Gameboy for MIST
----------------

This is an early version of a gameboy core for the MIST. 

A good number of games already work incl Tetris, Mario and Zelda. But
many things don't work fully yet. There's also no sound yet ...

If game cartridge is stored in the SD cards root directory under the name
gameboy.rom it will be loaded by default.
